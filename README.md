# Simple-Calculator
It is a simple calculator based on vue and electron as planned.

As its name, it is very much simple, not functioning at all at this moment.

To run the calculator as a Desktop App (in stead of a WebApp), you are required to install electron first:

` npm install electron`

Then, you can run it: ` npm start`

Of course, you can choose to have a look at the general view of the app directly  in your browsers by opening the file `index.html`.
