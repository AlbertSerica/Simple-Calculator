# Simple Calculator

## Intro



It is a simple calculator based on vue and electron as planned.

As its name, it is very much simple, not functioning at all at this moment.

~~To run the calculator as a Desktop App (in stead of a WebApp), you are required to install electron first:  `npm install electron` ( It is now provided and installed in the `node_modules` folder, certain steps can be ignored. ) Then, you can run it with `npm start`.~~

The app is now packed by [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) and released in `Calculator-win32-ia32/` .

You can choose to have a look at the general view of the app directly  in your browsers by opening the file `index.html`.

##Roadmap

Obviously, it is a "Learning by Doing" project, that is to say, the writer is limited to his knowledge and capability. The coding style might be terrible, the logic, not to mention, might be a mess. Let us hope that he will make some progress.

### To Dos:

- Learn the basic usage of Vue and Electron. Make the components work. ~~We may also need the help of Element UI.~~ 
- ~~Learn how to Webpack.~~ Considering the project is not that  complex, I will not use webpack.
- Perfect all the expected functions and features VERY SLOWLY.
- Publish the final version for distribution.
