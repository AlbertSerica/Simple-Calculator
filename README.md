#Intro



It is a simple calculator based on vue and electron as planned.

As its name, it is very much simple, not functioning at all at this moment.

To run the calculator as a Desktop App (in stead of a WebApp), you are required to install electron first:  `npm install electron` ( It is now provided and installed in the `node_modules` folder, certain steps can be ignored ) 

Then, you can run it with `npm start`.

Of course, you can choose to have a look at the general view of the app directly  in your browsers by opening the file `index.html`.



## Roadmap



Obviously, it is a "Learning by Doing" project, that is to say, the writer is limited to his knowledge and capability. The coding style might be terrible, the logic, not to mention, might be a mess. Let us hope that he will make some progress.

### To Dos:

- Learn the basic usage of Vue and Electron. Make the components work. We may also need the help of Element UI.
- Learn how to Webpack.
- Publish the final version for distribution.
